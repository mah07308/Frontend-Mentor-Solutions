## My process

I used HTML5, CSS, and flexbox to complete this project. I had initially used absolute positioning to center the card and floats to align the statistics. Then switched to flexbox.

Used ::before and ::after along with absolute positioning to position the background images relative to the profile card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Fixing the background images so that they do not move when resizing the browser window using ::before and ::after selectors and absolute positioning.
